The files in this folder are:

1) All_TQC.csv : All data extracted from the Topological Quantum Chemistry (Topological Materials Database) website. Only semimetals were extracted.
2) Dataset Materials Cloud : Data taken from the Materials Cloud research paper, "High-throughput screening of Weyl semimetals".
3) semimetals.csv : These are all the Weyl and Dirac semimetals obtained from reviewing literature.

All the remaning files are the dataset files of the Topogivity research paper, "Topogivity: A Machine-Learned Chemical Rule for Discovering Topological Materials". They are:
1) case1_ccmp.txt : All the materials that are trivial (not topological).
2) case3_ccmp.txt : These are topological materials.
3) tci_ccmp.txt : Topological Crystalline Insulators.
4) ti_ccmp.txt : Topological Insulators.
